But within that first year, they got their asses kicked, then booted out (back to Manhattan Island) by the Mespeatches Native American tribe (origins of the name 'Maspeth'). This beer is a recipe using ingredients that those first Dutch colonists would have had access to in 1642. Barley and Cluster hops were available at the time but often in short supply, so to supplement a recipe, colonial brewers used corn, rye, wheat, oats, buckwheat, and honey in their grain bills. To supplement bittering hops if in short supply, spruce tips would be used. All above ingredies are included in this recipe. The rsult is a balanced, sessiony ale - slightly cloudy (from the wheat), slightly earthy and bitter (from the spruce addition) - with a story to ponder... Sort of the 'b' side version of the story of Thanksgiving. \nCall it a colonial pale, old fashioned ale, a gruit, or whatever category you think fits. ",

The line was crazy long, and they sold out of tour tickets for the rest of the day, and the line to get tokens was too long and the line to get beer was long and... I don't know. I just didn't love it. \n\nPros: Very cool space. \nCons: It was overcrowded. And $5 for a plastic cup of beer is fine, I guess, but I wish they'd had more sample options (tastings of all the beers for like $20 or something).\n\nWe ended up talking our way onto the 4:30 tour by chance, which redeemed this trip - but I wouldn't count on that working again. The tour was pretty simple, the tour guide was cool and funny but it was pretty basic. Not sure I'd come back, honestly, or recommend it to anyone if they're not super into Brooklyn Brewery already.",

Simple Pleasures: East IPA, straight from the tap at the brewery - delicious and refreshing.

Staff was friendly and quick. \n\nThe big downside is the setup of this place: you wait in a line to get in, then wait in a line to get tokens, then wait in a line to exchange those tokens for beer. Could they have a more convoluted process? The tables and seating might as well not exist as the place is over-crowded and, as other reviewers note, full of drunk twenty-somethings. \n\nBottom line: If you're a grumpy old person - prepare to be unhappy. If you're a drunk twenty-something - prepare to wait in line to get decent beer surrounded by your peers and frowning old(er) people.",

The owners  were extremely welcoming and told us about their history and how they just moved to the Bronx. I've been to a lot of breweries - and this was easily the most personal and best tour I've ever been given. The food is great - especially the beer cheese with the pretzels, and the beer is really tasty and different. I highly recommend it to anyone in NYC looking for a great experience and great beer. 👌🏼",

We brew craft beers for draft consumption, bottles, and cans in limited release. We believe local breweries play an important role in their communities which is why, despite the challenges of running a brewery in NYC, we couldn’t choose anywhere but Brooklyn as our home. The brewery is located on the edge of Carroll Gardens, only two blocks from the subway. Our tap room is open to the public and we also offer tours of our brewery (by appointment).",

The setting is good for hanging out most of the day and it helps that the beer is pretty good. They do not serve food so bring something and make a picnic. They have about a dozen brews on tap of various styles and strength. The flagship Banner Ale and the Octoberfest were two of my favorites. They are even dog friendly at the outside section which is awesome. The outside is pretty big with a bunch of picnic tables while inside only has seating for a few folks. The only odd part is the layout where you have to walk through the brewery to get to the outside which can be a bit of a pain with a dog and stroller (if so inclined). It’s a good place to bring some food and hang out for the whole day while sampling their full range. It does get a bit crowded on weekend evenings these days.\n",

It is great to see this destination brewery with my own eyes. Now, this area is an industrial location in the South Bronx.  Driving would be the best way to get here but our group of three decided to take the subway which is very doable with a ten minute walk from the 6 Train stop.\n\nAs you approach and enter this large industrial facility, there is tasting room to the left and straight ahead to go into the brewery. If you go through the brewery area, there is a large outdoor space. It's December now so it is definitely off-season for this outdoor location but I was told by the Brooklyn Brewery staff and tour guide, Kate that it is a great space on a summer weekend. They are food trucks and live music. I definitely need to come back and check it out.\n\nThey offer free tours of the brewery on the weekend. It was a quiet Sunday afternoon so we had a private tour because we were the only new arrivals at tour time. Kate explained very succinctly and efficiently the brewing process and more about Bronx Brewery. Bronx Brewery stated in 2011 but it only opened this brewery location in 2014 after a few years of renovation woes, thanks Hurricane Sandy.\n\nIf you check-in with Yelp, you get $1 off a pint after your tasting. We took advantage of this discount which was much appreciated. We decided to eat before we arrived but there is a good selection of small appetizer types of food such as prosciutto ($10), pretzels ($6) and toketti ($6). The toketti are Sardinian style flatbread chip-type munchies.\n\nFor the beer, we tried plenty of brews. We ended up with three different pints. The Rye Pale Ale was our first selection a crisp, golden-orange pale ale with rye and piney hops.  The other two selections were the seasonal brews, Winter and Bogsmash. The Winter Pale Ale is an amber colored pale ale brewed with cinnamon, molasses, cloves and ginger that has a spiced the flavor.  The Bogsmash Pale Ale is a fall brew with cranberries with a subtle tart aftertaste.\n\nA few of my friends have personally recommended this location so I am happy to have made it to this location.",

Everything is bomber style, but the beers aren't too high gravity. Very rich, complex, nuanced flavors. Wide variety of brew types, all great. Make sure you pour with a little head, because every beer has a delicious one. But, those are just their beers, which you can get in a few places. \n\nThe tasting session at the brewery itself is amazing. You're literally tucked away in a corner of the brewery at small makeshift tables. The kegs and brew instruments are right there. So it smells like beer being made and you can watch them close out their day and see how they brew. They're more than willing to talk about the brews and they all have a great passion for brewing. It ends up being an amazing experience for a beer lover. Can't recommend enough. \n\nLove the brew dog too! ",
